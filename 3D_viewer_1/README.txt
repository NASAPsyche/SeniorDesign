This is a prototype we can see in the browser

opening index.html with chrome will give the following error:
"It seems your browser does not support running Unity WebGL content from file:// urls. Please upload it to an http server, or try a different browser."

open firefox browser and in the firefox address bar type 'about:config' and hit enter
then search for 'privacy.file_unique_origin' and change it to false 
open index.html with firefox
